            <h2 class="heading-section head-two"><u>Proximity</u></h2>
            <h3 class="heading-section">Yahoo</h3>

            <p class="para-text">The Principle of Proximity states: Group related items together. Move them physically
                close to each other
                so the related items are seen as one cohesive group rather than
                a bunch of unrelated bits.

                Items or groups of information that are not related to each other should not be in close proximity
                (nearness) to the other elements, which gives the reader an instant visual clue to the organization and
                content of the page.

                A very simple example, above, illustrates this concept. That’s the Principle of Proximity—on a page (as
                in Life), physical closeness implies a relationship.</p>

        <!--Repetition section-->
        <section class="reps-section principle-sec">
            <h2 class="heading-section"><u>Repetition</u></h2>
            <h3 class="heading-section">Buffalo Wild Wings</h3>
            <p class="text">Link: <a href="https://www.buffalowildwings.com/" target="https://www.buffalowildwings.com/">Buffalo Wild Wings</a></p>
            <img src="../lesson2/images/repetition-bdubs.jpg" alt="bdubs-sc">
            <p class="para-text">
                The Principle of Repetition states: Repeat some aspect of the design throughout the entire piece. The
                repetitive element may be a bold font, a thick rule (line), a certain bullet, design element, color,
                format, spatial relationships, etc. It can be anything that a reader will visually recognize.

                As you can see above; the colors, fonts and spacing between the letters are the same. This page applied
                the principle of repetition very well.

            <img src="../lesson2/images/contrast-nike.jpg" alt="nike-sc">
            <p class="para-text">The Principle of Contrast states: Contrast various elements of the piece to draw a
                reader’s eye into the
                page. If two items are not exactly the same, then make them different. Really different. Contrast not
                only serves
                to draw in the eye, but you can use it to organize information, clarify the hierarchy, guide a reader
                around the page, and provide a focus.We can see on
                the picture that the colors are well contrast with the people that are wearing. There is a contrast
                between dark and light. </p>
