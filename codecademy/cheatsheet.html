         <h3>Color Schemes</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Monochromatic</li>
            <li>Complementary</li>
            <li>Analogous</li>
            <li>Triadic</li>
         </ul>

         <div>
            <h4>Monochromatic Designs</h4>
            <p>The most basic color scheme possible utilizes a single color with varying shades and tints to create a
               monochromatic palette.

               Each color in the scheme is derived from the base color. While all elements within the design may feel
               similar, you can help eliminate the monotonous feeling with high contrast. This means when you are
               selecting a monochromatic color scheme, it’s important to select a much lighter and much darker shade of
               the main color.

               These monochromatic color schemes are beneficial in that they provide an organized impression when
               applied to your designs. The use of a single color can provide an immediate sense of harmony.

               Monochromatic schemes can also consist of black and white, with varying shades of gray, as you see in our
               current site. However, let’s enhance it by selecting a different base color and applying a monochromatic
               color scheme to our website!</p>

         <div>
            <h4>Complementary Designs</h4>
            <p>As depicted in the diagram before, a complementary color scheme utilizes colors opposite from each other
               on the color wheel. For instance, if you were to select blue as your main color, it would create maximum
               contrast and intensity with orange.

               Complementary color palettes are very common in logos and uniforms. For example, the Los Angeles Lakers
               and Minnesota Vikings feature purples and yellows; the Chicago Bears and New York Mets incorporate blues
               and oranges. These complementary schemes provide a dramatic display of color, which can be applied to
               websites as well.

               Complementary color schemes are popular on the web as they have high contrast in the color pairing.

               They can seem clashing if complementary colors are used for large areas that are directly next to each
               other. However, when used strategically, they can draw attention to certain elements on the page that you
               want users to focus on.</p>

         <div>
            <h4>Analogous Color Schemes</h4>
            <p>Analogous color schemes apply three or more colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel.
               Typically, there is one dominant color (or hue), combined with a second to support, and a third to accent
               the color palette.
               Analogous color schemes create a visually pleasing and calming display. For instance, the color blue can
               pair nicely with both teal and green. However, analogous color schemes provide a low-contrast experience,
               since all colors fall in line with one another.

               They shouldn’t be used for content that needs the user’s direct attention, but they can be used to create
               backgrounds that do not compete with the main content of the site.

               Let’s adjust some of the colors on our website to see how an analogous scheme would look!</p>

         <div>
            <h4>Triadic Color Schemes</h4>
            <p>Triadic color schemes, much like complementary schemes, provide additional pops of color while allowing
               for some flexibility in the range you can use.

               These consist of three colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel.
               For instance, if we stick with blue being our main color, we would then select red-orange and
               yellow-green as the pairing combinations. This creates a triangle of colors within the color wheel and
               gives us a wider palette to choose from.

               Triadic color schemes are useful in that they create a sense of equality, vibrancy, and security in your
               designs.</p>
